# WebXAll

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version **18.0.0** or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

---

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.git
cd WebXAII
```

### Install Dependencies

Once inside the project folder, run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### üöÄ Start the Development Environment (Frontend Only)

To start the frontend development server with hot-reloading (handled by Webpack), run:

```bash
npm run dev-front
```

During development, the frontend uses mock data provided in [`src/utils/test_data.js`](src/utils/test_data.js).

> **Note:** This file simulates API responses and is useful when the backend is not running.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Optional: Start the Backend Server

If you want to test the application with a real backend, you can start the backend server with:

```bash
npm run dev-back
# Or with nodemon: ./node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js functions/index.js
```

Make sure the `MAIN_URL` variable in [`src/utils/test_data.js`](src/utils/test_data.js) points to the correct backend address (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) so that API calls are routed properly.

### üì¶ Build for Production

To generate the production build of the project, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command uses Webpack to bundle and optimize the frontend application. The output will be placed in the [`dist`](./dist) folder.

You can then serve the contents of the `dist` folder.

---

## üß© Customizing User Data

To use your own data with the application, you need to modify the content of the `data/` directory located in the backend.

The structure is as follows:

```
functions/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ protocols/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ p1-test.json          # Protocol file linked to a user
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-data/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ users.json                # User configuration file
```

### üë§ Defining Users

All users are defined in the [`users.json`](functions/data/users.json) file.

Example:

```json
{
    "test": {
        "roles": "user",
        "protocol": "p1-test.json"
    }
}
```

* `"test"` is the **user ID**.
* `"roles"` defines the role (currently unused but reserved for permission levels).
* `"protocol"` refers to a file in the `protocols/` folder, which describes the expected experiment for that user.

### üìÅ Adding New Users

To add a new user:

1. Add a new entry in `users.json`:

   ```json
   {
       "newUserId": {
           "roles": "user",
           "protocol": "p2-example.json"
       }
   }
   ```
2. Link the associated protocol file in `protocols/`, e.g., `protocols/p2-example.json`.

üîÅ Sharing Protocols Between Users

You can assign the same protocol file to multiple users.

Example:

```
{
    "user1": { "roles": "user", "protocol": "p1-common.json" },
    "user2": { "roles": "user", "protocol": "p1-common.json" },
    "user3": { "roles": "user", "protocol": "p1-common.json" }
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure that each protocol filename in `users.json` matches an actual file in the `protocols/` folder.

## Implementing a protocol

A protocol file (in `protocols/`) is a JSON file which defines all the content for a given protocol. It is defined as
a list of views, and each view is defined as an object (or dictionary).

```json
   [
      {
        "type":  "p-instruction",
        [...]
      },
      {
        "type":  "p-questionnaire",
        [...]
      },
      {
        "type":  "p-task",
        [...]
      }
   ]
```
The views can be configured as follows.

### Instruction view

An instruction view is obtained by using the type ```"type": "p-instruction"```.
It supports the following configuration attributes.
* "title" : Title displayed in bold (text).
* "body_text" : Text content (text).
* "button_text" : Text content of the button (text).
* "with_button" : Whether to display a button allowing to go to the next view or not (boolean).

Example :

### Questionnaire view

A questionnaire view is obtained by using the type ```"type": "p-questionnaire"```. It is defined by the following 
structure of attributes (besides ```"type"```).
* ```"questions"``` : list of question objects, which are each defined by a dictionary containing the following attributes:
  * ```"type"``` : defines the type of the question (either ```"radio"``` for exclusive choices, ```"checkbox"``` for non-exclusive
  choices, ```"textfield"``` for an open text answer and ```"slider"``` for a slider input).
  * ```"answers"``` : list of possible answers if applicable (list of text strings).
  * ```"primary_text"``` : Title of the question to be written in bold above the choices (text, optional).
  * ```"secondary_text"``` : Additional text for the question to be written in smaller characters (text, optional).

Example :

### Task view

A task view is obtained by using the type ```"type": "p-task"```. Each task is defined by an object (or dictionary) 
containing the following attributes (besides ```"type"```).
* ```title``` : Title of the task (optional, text).
* ```desc``` : Text description of the task to be displayed below the title (optional, text).
* ```show_progression_bar``` : Whether to show the progression bar on the view (default: **false**, optional, boolean).
* ```randomize``` : Whether to randomize the order used to display the instances to the user (default: **false**, optional, boolean).
